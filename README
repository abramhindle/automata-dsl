Automata DSL

Define a random cellular automata game that will be compiled down to something
managable that will actually run on a large world (640x480) on a reasonable
machine (1.7ghz works).

You define an input automata file with patterns and replacement patterns then
the common lisp automata generator (see from-file in Makefile) rotates and
reflects said patterns and produces a C program (a .h file to be included in
auto-test.c) written in SDL that lets you play with your automata.

The concepts are entities, patterns and matches and replacements.

The number keys change the current entity of your mouse cursor.
'x' exits
'c' resets the world
'b' blanks the world
'+' increases cursor size
'-' decreases cursor size

You'll need the SDL devel packages installed to make the software.
